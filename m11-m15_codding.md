    y = x + 6 #new block
    print(y) #new block
```
**What it does:**  
Defines two functions.  
- `code1()` assigns 3 to x, 9 to y, and prints 9.  
- `code2()` assigns 10 to x, 16 to y, and prints 16.  
These functions do nothing until called.

---

### 21. Conditional Statement
```python
x = 10
y = 560
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
```
**What it does:**  
Checks if x is less than y (True), then prints a message.  
**Output:**  
x is less than y

---

### 22. Conditional with Else
```python
x = 10
y = 560
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    print("x is not less than y")

**Output:**  
a is greater than b

---

### 27. If/Else Boolean Logic Example

counter = 0
while counter < 3:
    print("inside loop")
    counter += 1
else:
    print("outside loop")
```
