Introduction to Credential Harvesting
﻿
Credentials are used to access devices and systems on a given network. Credentials include user account names and passwords. According to MITRE ATT&CK Tactic Credential Access (TA0006), harvesting credentials consists of techniques for accessing, identifying, and stealing user account names and/or passwords. Techniques used to obtain credentials include keylogging, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, phishing, and credential dumping. Specific techniques are detailed later in this lesson. The use of legitimate credentials gives adversaries access to systems, making them harder to detect, and provides the opportunity to create more accounts to help achieve their goals. 


Credential harvesting is a tactic in the Enterprise Framework from MITRE ATT&CK, as shown in Figure 6.1-1:

Credential harvesting is also included in the reconnaissance phase of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. According to MITRE ATT&CK, "the reconnaissance phase consists of techniques used and data that adversaries gather that can be leveraged to aid or help coordinate future campaigns or attacks, which likely occur later within the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. The data collected during the reconnaissance phase can be collected in an active or passive manner and information may include data points related to target systems, users, architecture, devices, or infrastructure."


Active data collection occurs when the adversary has infiltrated the target network in an attempt to identify and leverage any vulnerabilities and collect information available. Comparatively, passive data collection is not as infiltrated in the target network. Passive data collection occurs when the adversary is not actively manipulating or searching on the target network, rather, the adversary may be listening or watching traffic.
