Policies, Procedures, and Regulations 

Another critical component of the CPT OP are the policies, procedures, and regulations that leadership and governing bodies establish for hunt missions. There are numerous additional guidelines that govern the CPT. However, the following two Titles of the United States Code are the most noteworthy:

Title 10. Concerns military operations and provides the legal basis for the roles, missions, and organization of each of the services as well as the Department of Defense (DoD).

Title 50. Concerns intelligence organizations and provides guidance for how to conduct intelligence-gathering efforts. Also provides governance for other national defense activities.

Cyber Threat Hunting

CTH is the process of actively searching information systems to identify and stop malicious cyberspace activity. The term “hunting” refers only to internal defensive measures that require maneuver within the defended network to identify, locate, and eradicate an advanced, persistent threat. A primary component of threat hunting is based on detecting TTPs. 

CTH Kill Chain

The Start. Search for MCA by filtering out legitimate or expected activity on the network.
Refinement. Find suspicious activity. This triggers a deeper investigation and increases search efforts. 
Discovery. Discover the root cause of the malicious behavior. 
Response. Calculate and assess the attack. Remediate the threat based on this information.
Continuous Improvement. Update defenses to prevent future attacks that use the same TTPs discovered during the hunt.

What is NOT CTH

CTH starts before any threat has been found. On the other hand, practices such as incident forensics or incident response occur after identifying an incident or compromise. The aim of CTH is to illuminate an adversary before a known incident. This requires analyzing the current environment and its conditions to identify any evidence of intrusion or compromise before any are known to exist.

CTH Methodologies

-Analytics-driven

The analytics-driven methodology leverages data and analytics. This methodology applies complex queries and algorithms to data sets, often using software  automation. A key distinction with the analytics methodology is that it does not require physical access to local machines, networks, or systems. CTH analysts   using the analytics-driven methodology gather data artifacts consisting of sensor alerts, system logs, and network traffic. Combining knowledge of data artifacts   with knowledge of automated analysis capabilities allows the analysts to develop a picture of the network terrain.

-Situational awareness-driven

The situational awareness-driven methodology leverages an advanced understanding of a particular cyberspace terrain to detect anomalous activity. Similar to the analytics methodology, situational awareness does not require physical access to local systems. Data artifacts pertaining to the operating environment are critical to this methodology. CTH analysts examine data artifacts over time in order to understand system normality and detect outliers in behavior. This often leads to discovering potential MCA.

-Intelligence-driven

The intelligence-driven methodology leverages timely, accurate, mature Cyberspace Threat Intelligence (CTI) to detect advanced cyberspace threats. The intelligence-driven methodology requires physical access to local systems.

Cyber Threat Intelligence Overview

Analysts using the intelligence-driven methodology leverage CTI. CTI is information that has been analyzed to aid an organization in identifying, assessing, monitoring, and responding to cyber threats. Organizations generally produce various types of CTI, which they can share internally for CTH. Information may also be derived externally, from outside of the organization. Examples of CTI include:

Indicators (system artifacts or observables associated with an attack)
TTPs
Security alerts
Threat intelligence reports
Recommended security tool configurations

CTI can trigger a hunt operation by warning of an imminent or already-realized cyber attack, or by reporting on new indicators or adversaries that were recently seen in the wild. 

Types of CTI 

Organizations develop different types of CTI, depending on who is receiving the information and what details it includes. The three categories of CTI include the following:

Strategic. Broad, general information that provides high-level threats and activities in a non-technical delivery.

Tactical. TTP outlines for a technical delivery that explains how the adversary may attempt to attack the network. 

Operational. Purely technical information about specific attacks, experiences, or campaigns that provides actionable information regarding activities that have been previously identified.

CTI Sources

CTI is derived from both internal and external sources. Internal refers to CTI collected from within the network or organization where the hunt operation is occurring. Internal CTI typically includes artifacts such as network event logs, IP Addresses, or records of past incident responses. External CTI refers to CTI collected from sources outside of (or "external" to) the network or organization where the hunt operation is occurring. External CTI typically includes artifacts such as those found on the open internet or technical sources (such as MITRE ATT&CK). A key benefit of external CTI is that organizations can leverage the collective knowledge, experience, and capabilities from the community to gain a more complete understanding of the threats the organization may face.

IOCs

As defined by the CWP an IOC is, “a forensic artifact observed on a computer network or in a computer operating system which indicates an intrusion.” IOCs change and can take on a wide variety of topics and forms. Some common IOCs include the following:

Unexpected network traffic (inbound or outbound)
Unusual internet protocol (IP) addresses
Connections to strange geographic areas
Increased activity by a privileged user
Increased volume of data transmission

TTPs

TTPs are a chain, or sequence, of actions taken by the adversary during their actions or campaign. There is a wide variety of TTPs, however, some common TTPs include using a specific malware variant, attack tool, delivery mechanism (such as phishing), or exploit.

TTPs are located at the top of the pyramid. According to Bianco, “at the apex are the TTPs. When you detect and respond at this level, you are operating directly on adversary behaviors, not against their tools.”
