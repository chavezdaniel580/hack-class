Policies, Procedures, and Regulations-------------------------------

Another critical component of the CPT OP are the policies, procedures, and regulations that leadership and governing bodies establish for hunt missions. There are numerous additional guidelines that govern the CPT. However, the following two Titles of the United States Code are the most noteworthy:

Title 10. Concerns military operations and provides the legal basis for the roles, missions, and organization of each of the services as well as the Department of Defense (DoD).

Title 50. Concerns intelligence organizations and provides guidance for how to conduct intelligence-gathering efforts. Also provides governance for other national defense activities.
