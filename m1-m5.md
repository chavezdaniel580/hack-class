This lesson explains the six distinct steps of the CPT OP with regard to threat hunting:
Objectives, Effects, Guidance
Terrain Identification and Prioritization 
Capability Analysis and Force Allocation
Orders Production and Dissemination
Tactical Planning and Mission Execution
Assessment

Policies, Procedures, and Regulations 

Another critical component of the CPT OP are the policies, procedures, and regulations that leadership and governing bodies establish for hunt missions. There are numerous additional guidelines that govern the CPT. However, the following two Titles of the United States Code are the most noteworthy:

Title 10. Concerns military operations and provides the legal basis for the roles, missions, and organization of each of the services as well as the Department of Defense (DoD).

Title 50. Concerns intelligence organizations and provides guidance for how to conduct intelligence-gathering efforts. Also provides governance for other national defense activities.

Cyber Threat Hunting

CTH is the process of actively searching information systems to identify and stop malicious cyberspace activity. The term “hunting” refers only to internal defensive measures that require maneuver within the defended network to identify, locate, and eradicate an advanced, persistent threat. A primary component of threat hunting is based on detecting TTPs. 

CTH Kill Chain

The Start. Search for MCA by filtering out legitimate or expected activity on the network.
Refinement. Find suspicious activity. This triggers a deeper investigation and increases search efforts. 
Discovery. Discover the root cause of the malicious behavior. 
Response. Calculate and assess the attack. Remediate the threat based on this information.
Continuous Improvement. Update defenses to prevent future attacks that use the same TTPs discovered during the hunt.

What is NOT CTH

CTH starts before any threat has been found. On the other hand, practices such as incident forensics or incident response occur after identifying an incident or compromise. The aim of CTH is to illuminate an adversary before a known incident. This requires analyzing the current environment and its conditions to identify any evidence of intrusion or compromise before any are known to exist.

CTH Methodologies
-Analytics-driven

The analytics-driven methodology leverages data and analytics. This methodology applies complex queries and algorithms to data sets, often using software  automation. A key distinction with the analytics methodology is that it does not require physical access to local machines, networks, or systems. CTH analysts   using the analytics-driven methodology gather data artifacts consisting of sensor alerts, system logs, and network traffic. Combining knowledge of data artifacts   with knowledge of automated analysis capabilities allows the analysts to develop a picture of the network terrain.

-Situational awareness-driven

The situational awareness-driven methodology leverages an advanced understanding of a particular cyberspace terrain to detect anomalous activity. Similar to the analytics methodology, situational awareness does not require physical access to local systems. Data artifacts pertaining to the operating environment are critical to this methodology. CTH analysts examine data artifacts over time in order to understand system normality and detect outliers in behavior. This often leads to discovering potential MCA.

-Intelligence-driven

The intelligence-driven methodology leverages timely, accurate, mature Cyberspace Threat Intelligence (CTI) to detect advanced cyberspace threats. The intelligence-driven methodology requires physical access to local systems.
