Policies, Procedures, and Regulations 

Another critical component of the CPT OP are the policies, procedures, and regulations that leadership and governing bodies establish for hunt missions. There are numerous additional guidelines that govern the CPT. However, the following two Titles of the United States Code are the most noteworthy:

Title 10. Concerns military operations and provides the legal basis for the roles, missions, and organization of each of the services as well as the Department of Defense (DoD).

Title 50. Concerns intelligence organizations and provides guidance for how to conduct intelligence-gathering efforts. Also provides governance for other national defense activities.

Cyber Threat Hunting

CTH is the process of actively searching information systems to identify and stop malicious cyberspace activity. The term “hunting” refers only to internal defensive measures that require maneuver within the defended network to identify, locate, and eradicate an advanced, persistent threat. A primary component of threat hunting is based on detecting TTPs. 

CTH Kill Chain

The Start. Search for MCA by filtering out legitimate or expected activity on the network.
Refinement. Find suspicious activity. This triggers a deeper investigation and increases search efforts. 
Discovery. Discover the root cause of the malicious behavior. 
Response. Calculate and assess the attack. Remediate the threat based on this information.
Continuous Improvement. Update defenses to prevent future attacks that use the same TTPs discovered during the hunt.

What is NOT CTH

CTH starts before any threat has been found. On the other hand, practices such as incident forensics or incident response occur after identifying an incident or compromise. The aim of CTH is to illuminate an adversary before a known incident. This requires analyzing the current environment and its conditions to identify any evidence of intrusion or compromise before any are known to exist.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CTH Methodologies

-Analytics-driven

The analytics-driven methodology leverages data and analytics. This methodology applies complex queries and algorithms to data sets, often using software  automation. A key distinction with the analytics methodology is that it does not require physical access to local machines, networks, or systems. CTH analysts   using the analytics-driven methodology gather data artifacts consisting of sensor alerts, system logs, and network traffic. Combining knowledge of data artifacts   with knowledge of automated analysis capabilities allows the analysts to develop a picture of the network terrain.

-Situational awareness-driven

The situational awareness-driven methodology leverages an advanced understanding of a particular cyberspace terrain to detect anomalous activity. Similar to the analytics methodology, situational awareness does not require physical access to local systems. Data artifacts pertaining to the operating environment are critical to this methodology. CTH analysts examine data artifacts over time in order to understand system normality and detect outliers in behavior. This often leads to discovering potential MCA.

-Intelligence-driven

The intelligence-driven methodology leverages timely, accurate, mature Cyberspace Threat Intelligence (CTI) to detect advanced cyberspace threats. The intelligence-driven methodology requires physical access to local systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cyber Threat Intelligence Overview

Analysts using the intelligence-driven methodology leverage CTI. CTI is information that has been analyzed to aid an organization in identifying, assessing, monitoring, and responding to cyber threats. Organizations generally produce various types of CTI, which they can share internally for CTH. Information may also be derived externally, from outside of the organization. Examples of CTI include:

Indicators (system artifacts or observables associated with an attack)
TTPs
Security alerts
Threat intelligence reports
Recommended security tool configurations

CTI can trigger a hunt operation by warning of an imminent or already-realized cyber attack, or by reporting on new indicators or adversaries that were recently seen in the wild. 

Types of CTI 

Organizations develop different types of CTI, depending on who is receiving the information and what details it includes. The three categories of CTI include the following:

Strategic. Broad, general information that provides high-level threats and activities in a non-technical delivery.

Tactical. TTP outlines for a technical delivery that explains how the adversary may attempt to attack the network. 

Operational. Purely technical information about specific attacks, experiences, or campaigns that provides actionable information regarding activities that have been previously identified.

CTI Sources

CTI is derived from both internal and external sources. Internal refers to CTI collected from within the network or organization where the hunt operation is occurring. Internal CTI typically includes artifacts such as network event logs, IP Addresses, or records of past incident responses. External CTI refers to CTI collected from sources outside of (or "external" to) the network or organization where the hunt operation is occurring. External CTI typically includes artifacts such as those found on the open internet or technical sources (such as MITRE ATT&CK). A key benefit of external CTI is that organizations can leverage the collective knowledge, experience, and capabilities from the community to gain a more complete understanding of the threats the organization may face. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IOCs

As defined by the CWP an IOC is, “a forensic artifact observed on a computer network or in a computer operating system which indicates an intrusion.” IOCs change and can take on a wide variety of topics and forms. Some common IOCs include the following:

Unexpected network traffic (inbound or outbound)
Unusual internet protocol (IP) addresses
Connections to strange geographic areas
Increased activity by a privileged user
Increased volume of data transmission

TTPs

TTPs are a chain, or sequence, of actions taken by the adversary during their actions or campaign. There is a wide variety of TTPs, however, some common TTPs include using a specific malware variant, attack tool, delivery mechanism (such as phishing), or exploit.

TTPs are located at the top of the pyramid. According to Bianco, “at the apex are the TTPs. When you detect and respond at this level, you are operating directly on adversary behaviors, not against their tools.”

########## Developing a Hunt Hypothesis ###########

What is Threat Hunting?

hreat hunting is the proactive and iterative search through networks, endpoints, or datasets to detect unknown malicious, suspicious, or anomalous activities that have not been detected by existing automated tools. Successful threat hunting requires an understanding of adversary activity. The Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain is an analytic framework that breaks down the seven phases that a threat follows to achieve an objective, in an attack against an ally network. The attachment Cyberspace Threat Hunting explains the seven phases in greater detail. The phases of the Cyber Kill Chain include the following:

Reconnaissance. The threat collects information on the potential target before any attack actually happens. The threat may still be choosing a target in this phase.
Weaponization. The threat creates a malicious payload to exploit the targeted friendly network. 
Delivery. The threat delivers the malicious payload to the target victim by email or other means. 
Exploitation. The threat exploits a vulnerability identified earlier in order to execute the malicious payload. 
Installation. The threat installs malware onto the victim's network.
Command and Control. The threat creates a Command and Control (C2) channel to continue communication and operations of the installed malware and manipulation of the victim's system. 
Actions on Objectives. The threat performs the steps necessary to achieve its goals within the friendly network.    

What is NOT Threat Hunting

There are a few clear lines between threat hunting and other cybersecurity tasks, such as incident response. Some organizations may be organized such that threat hunting and incident response are done by the same set of personnel. However, each activity has its unique traits and goals that differentiate it from one another. Incident response is the organization's process to investigate a known or suspected cybersecurity incident. The following tasks are not considered part of threat hunting tasks. Instead, they are often conducted in parallel with threat hunting or may be initiated by threat hunting.

Incident response of a reported compromise. The goal of threat hunting is to identify evidence of unknown or unreported Malicious Cyberspace Activity (MCA) that may indicate a compromise or intrusion.

Installing tools and waiting for alerts. Threat hunting requires proactive analysis and data of adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) in order to identify MCA.

Reporting on incidents or intrusions. An incident response team provides in-depth analysis and reporting on an identified intrusion. Threat hunting identifies MCA prior to a known incident.

Incident forensics. This is performed by an incident response team after suspected MCA has been identified.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a Hunt Hypothesis?

A good hunt hypothesis accomplishes the following goals:
Direct analysts towards potential analysis methods.
Propose what attacker activity might look like when found.
Identify likely sources of evidence to hunt within.
Provide a path for analysts to follow to prove or disprove the hypothesis.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP)

T1589.001 Gather Victim Identity Information: Credentials
FARMCHASER has made use of victim organizations' account credentials by using methods such as phishing for information. They have been known to use compromised credentials in order to access sensitive information. 


T1212 Exploitation for Credential Access
FARMCHASER has also been known to exploit software vulnerabilities in order to collect victims' credentials. They tend to target Kerberos in order to gain domain user permissions on a system.


T1136.001 Create Account: Local Account
T1136.002 Create Account: Domain Account
FARMCHASER has created both local machine accounts and domain accounts in order to maintain persistence within an environment.


T1098 Account Manipulation
FARMCHASER has added, compromised, or maliciously created accounts to privileged security groups in order to maintain elevated access to victim networks.


T1567.002 Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage
FARMCHASER has used cloud storage services such as Dropbox or OneDrive to exfiltrate data over the internet.


T1039 Data from Network Shared Drive
FARMCHASER often searches through network shares on computers that they have compromised to find files of interest. Sensitive data that is found is collected in a central network location prior to exfiltration.


T1005 Data from Local System
FARMCHASER tends to also search local file systems or databases for sensitive files. 


T1114 Email Collection
FARMCHASER has targeted user email to collect sensitive information. The email subjects typically contain words such as payment, invoice, or urgent. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Possible Hypotheses
There are multiple hypotheses that can be made from the FARMCHASER threat intel brief and TTPs. Some possible hypotheses that could have been created include the following: 


FARMCHASER uses compromised credentials to access sensitive information.
FARMCHASER may create new user accounts within Active Directory (AD).
FARMCHASER may grant permissions to user accounts by adding them to the local Administrators security group.
FARMCHASER may grant permissions to user accounts by adding them to the Domain Admins or Backup Operators AD groups.
Malware is exfiltrating sensitive data to the internet from at least one of the domain controllers.
Malware is exfiltrating sensitive data to the internet from at least one of the servers responsible for the storage of that data.
FARMCHASER accesses sensitive data from servers by pivoting from systems defined in the tactical KT-C.
A local secondary system is connecting to the domain controller to gain access to sensitive information.

 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identifying and Collecting Data for Hunting

A CPT identifies the key tasks to meet the goals of the hunt operation when creating their tactical plan. For hunting operations, these key tasks include high-level hunt topics that can be broken down into individual hunts. In terms of collecting data from these data sources, a CPT must be prepared to adapt to a wide array of situations. No set plan can be established for collecting data from an environment, due to the variety of data sources available and the differences between networks. 


There are multiple different ways a CPT can collect data from data sources. A CPT could gain access to a pre-existing data source owned by the local network operators or could ask local administrators to configure a pre-existing stream to send data into the CPT's systems. A CPT could also gather data themselves by configuring a network tap or collecting the data directly from the endpoints if possible. A CPT should be familiar with the different types of data sources and security-related data that can exist within an environment. This allows the CPT to make informed decisions about which data sources are the most valuable during a hunt.


The following are broad categories of the different types of logs that an analyst could use during a hunt:
Host
Network
Security Appliance
Application

Host Logs

Each Operating System (OS) generates its own host logs. A wide variety of different host logs are available, but not all of them are security-focused. Additionally, different OSs contain different types of host logs, and CPT analysts that are performing a host log investigation must learn to use and examine different sources, types, and qualities of logs that each OS generates. 


The following are examples of some of the events that an OS generates that can be useful in a hunt:
A process that was started or stopped
A network connection that was attempted and failed
Multiple failed user logon attempts
An unknown device that was plugged into a system
Changes to system settings
Registry additions or modifications

Network Logs


Network logs are generated by software or devices that are connected to the network. They contain information about a connection such as its source, destination, associated ports, and the amount of data being transferred. Some network logs are generated as part of normal OS activity and may be accessed in the same way the host logs are accessed. Other, more advanced network logs are generated by networking appliances such as routers, firewalls, or proxy devices. 


Security Appliance Logs      


Security appliance logs are logs that are generated by a security appliance such as an intrusion detection system (IDS), anti-virus scanning devices, or content-filtering devices. These logs are typically related to potential malware or an IDS that has detected network traffic that patterns a potential attack since the goal of most security appliances is to prevent or detect MCA. 


Application Logs


Application logs are any logs that are generated by an individual application. Not all applications generate logs, and not all application logs are useful to an application. However, application logs can be useful to analysts in order to gain additional information on an attack, or when a specific application is exploited during an attack. Application logs can also be useful to analysts as a source of evidence or to fill potential visibility gaps in an investigation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-Authentication Brute Force Logs


The process of brute-forcing these accounts leaves some forensic residue in the logs. These authentication failures are not logged with a normal event ID 4625: An account failed to log on. Instead, they produce an event ID 4771 which is only on the DC. This event ID is described below:


Event ID: 4771, Kerberos pre-authentication failed
Result Code: 0x18 KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED
Bad password
Result Code: 0x6 KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN
Kerberos produces an error if the username is incorrect. Attackers can leverage this to guess usernames.

Defenders should monitor the following with this event log and attack:
High-value accounts, such as domain admins
Off-hours logs
Inactive accounts
Client Address field is outside the internal range
Large volume of logs
Incorrect pre-authentication type for the network
If only smartcards are allowed within the network (pre-authentication type 15) and the 4771 log shows a failure with pre-authentication type 2, then something is trying to use a password.




Golden Ticket Logs


Logging associated with a Golden Ticket is an exploit technique, but not directly due to a flaw in Kerberos. The tools executing this attack do not work exactly the same way that the native windows systems work. This creates anomalies within the logging. Below is a snapshot of the event logs associated with this attack and some notable features. The main point of this data is that hacking tools tend to leave odd entries within logs that will be inconsistent with how the legitimate system tools create logs.


Event ID: 4769, A Kerberos service ticket was requested
Location: Domain controller
Notable activity is a TGS being requested without a preceding TGT 

Event ID: 4627, Group membership information
Location: workstation/Domain controller	

Event ID: 4624, An account was successfully logged on
Location: workstation/Domain controller
Field: Account Domain may be the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) when it normally is the short domain name
Field: IpAddress may indicate the compromised host

Event ID: 4672, Admin Logon
Location: workstation
Field: Account Domain may be blank when it normally is the short domain name

Event ID: 4634, Account Logoff
Location: workstation
Field: Account Domain may be blank when it normally is the short domain name
