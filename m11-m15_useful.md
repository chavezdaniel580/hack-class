To list all possible cmdlets in a system, the cmdlet Get-Command is extremely helpful. 
Get-Command -Type Cmdlet



For example, executing the Get-Member cmdlet on any directory object, such as a userâ€™s Documents folder, returns the following output.
PS C:\Users\trainee> Get-Item ".\Documents\" | Get-Member

This cmdlet is used to retrieve a list of all scheduled tasks in the system. These are often a vector for adversary persistence or may be disabled by adversaries when the task runs scripts or programs to search for malicious activity.
