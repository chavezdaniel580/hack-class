Introduction to Credential Harvesting
﻿
Credentials are used to access devices and systems on a given network. Credentials include user account names and passwords. According to MITRE ATT&CK Tactic Credential Access (TA0006), harvesting credentials consists of techniques for accessing, identifying, and stealing user account names and/or passwords. Techniques used to obtain credentials include keylogging, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, phishing, and credential dumping. Specific techniques are detailed later in this lesson. The use of legitimate credentials gives adversaries access to systems, making them harder to detect, and provides the opportunity to create more accounts to help achieve their goals. 


Credential harvesting is a tactic in the Enterprise Framework from MITRE ATT&CK, as shown in Figure 6.1-1:
