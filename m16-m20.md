### CDAH-M16L1-Acquiring a Forensic Disk Image ###

Forensic Image File and Compression Formats
A forensic image is a copy of media, like a disk or Solid-State Drive (SSD), that can be entered legally into evidence in a court of law. Forensic images are needed to verify data integrity, because the data can be compared and verified to not have been tampered with after the image was taken. A forensic image includes all Operating System (OS) data and written bits, sectors, partitions, files, folders, master boot records, bits marked for deletion, and unallocated space. A forensic image can be manipulated and read without interacting with the original drive and the drive’s contents.

﻿

Collecting forensic images of disk sources can be accomplished in many ways and with different image formats. The image file type created depends on the tools used and the specifics of the source. An image file can be a single file that contains the entire disk source or a series of multiple files that collectively represent the source. Common image file types are as follows:

Raw byte-for-byte.
Single raw file (dd): A Linux command-line file system tool.
Split raw files (affuse): Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)–format files.
AFF (Advanced Forensic Format).
AFD (AFF multiple file).
AFM (AFF with external metadata).
EWF (Expert Witness format [EnCase]).
Split EWF (split E01 files): A file type used by forensic imaging tools, commonly used for legal evidence-based forensic images.
VM disk image.
VMDK.
VHD/VHDX.

Toolkits provide different types of image files, depending on the need. This lesson covers basic dd-based images, FTK® Imager images, and images opened for analysis with Autopsy.
